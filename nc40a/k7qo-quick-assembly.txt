    Chuck Adams, K7QO   Nov 11, 2017  0100UTC (last update)
    
    Thanks to Wayne Burdick, N6KR, for the use of the
    NorCal40A as a teaching exercise on qrp-tech in
    anticipation of the 25th anniversary of the transceiver.
    Thousands are assembled and ready to operate.  The anniversary
    party is to get them all back on the air and making noise in
    the ionosphere and music in the ears of operators worldwide.
    
    The series of assembly steps shown here are a minimal assembly
    manual for all who wish to build the NorCal40A from
    the qrp-tech PCB.  Experienced builders should not have
    problems.  Others are asked to get local help,
    if possible, in order to avoid pitfalls and possible
    failure of the project.  Don't be afraid to seek help.
    There is no kit of parts for this project.  Consider it
    a scavenger hunt.
    
    See <http://www.k7qo.com/> for lots of information.

       you should hear an increase in noise in
       the speaker or headphones.  Note that the frequency range of the
       noise is reduced from previous tests  because of the band pass 
       frequency range of the IF filter.  The noise level will be
       reduced in amplitude also.
    o  Can use remaining crystal with crystal oscillator/tester to
       generate a signal.

    WARNING.  From this point forward.  The transceiver should
    NEVER be keyed without a 50 ohm dummy load on the ant output
    connector or a tuned antenna for 40 meters.  The PA will be 
    damaged due to high SWR and resulting voltages on the 
    collector of the PA if this is not done.

    ===========================================================
    
    This completes assembly of the components on the PCB.
    Work now must be done to put transceiver in an enclosure
    of your choice with all controls, switches, power connector
    and antenna connector (BNC).  Then transceiver must be tested
    with dummy load and power measured and adjusted.  Several
    dummy loads with diode detection can be used to do this.
    
    See qrp-tech at yahoo groups for information and help, if
    needed.
    
    Everything has been done in creation of these steps above.
    Double check all your work and follow the schematics as you
    build and look for deviations.  Discussions will be in
    progress on substitute parts in future discussions on qrp-tech.
    
    73 and good luck,
